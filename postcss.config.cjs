// This PostCSS configuration file uses the Tailwind CSS plugin and autoprefixer.
// It is used to process CSS files, applying Tailwind's utility classes and adding vendor prefixes
// for better browser compatibility. The Tailwind CSS plugin is configured to work with the
// project's content files, which include HTML and JavaScript/TypeScript files in the src directory.
// The autoprefixer plugin automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules, ensuring that the styles
// work across different browsers. This setup is essential for modern web development, allowing
// developers to write clean, maintainable CSS while ensuring compatibility with various browsers.
// The configuration is straightforward, focusing on the essential plugins needed for a Tailwind CSS project.
